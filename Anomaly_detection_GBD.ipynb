        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding differences in mortality patterns across countries is essential for improving population health, guiding public health policy, and identifying areas where health systems may be under particular strain. While global mortality trends often follow broad and predictable patterns, some countries exhibit unusual or extreme cause-of-death profiles that merit closer investigation. Detecting such anomalies can help highlight potential public health challenges, data-quality issues, or structural health inequalities that may otherwise go unnoticed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, I apply anomaly detection techniques to country-level mortality data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2025 release, which reports estimates for the year 2023. The dataset contains cause-specific death rates per 100,000 population for countries worldwide, grouped into 20 major disease and injury categories, including cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, infectious diseases, maternal and neonatal disorders, and injuries. Each country is represented by a profile describing how mortality is distributed across these causes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this analysis is to identify countries whose mortality patterns deviate substantially from the global norm. Such deviations do not automatically imply data errors or policy failures; instead, they serve as signals for further investigation, helping researchers and decision-makers prioritize attention and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), several complementary anomaly detection approaches are applied:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Interquartile Range (IQR): a univariate statistical method used to identify unusually high or low death rates within individual causes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM): a machine learning technique designed to detect abnormal observations in high-dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Isolation Forest: an ensemble-based algorithm well suited for multivariate anomaly detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of country-level mortality patterns and detected anomalies.\n",
        "\n",
        "By comparing results across statistical and machine learning methods, this project aims to increase confidence in the identified anomalies and to demonstrate how multivariate approaches can capture complex patterns that may not be visible when examining causes of death in isolation.\n",
        "\n",
        "How do anomaly detection results differ between statistical and machine learning approaches?\n",
        "\n",
        "To what extent do multivariate methods provide additional insight beyond univariate analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this project illustrates how data-driven techniques can support global health analysis by identifying atypical mortality patterns that warrant closer examination by researchers, policymakers, and public health stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Public health context and analytical considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "In population health data, anomalies typically represent a small fraction of observations, often on the order of a few percent. However, unlike operational sensor data, deviations in health outcomes must be interpreted with care. An unusually high death rate from a single cause may reflect well-known epidemiological realities (such as regional disease burdens) rather than a true abnormality.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this reason, the analysis emphasizes not only univariate outliers but also combinations of causes. For example, a country may not appear anomalous when considering cardiovascular mortality alone, but a simultaneous elevation across cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and kidney disease may indicate broader systemic health challenges. Conversely, low mortality from certain causes may reflect demographic structure, reporting practices, or successful prevention strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because this project is conducted without direct input from national health authorities or domain experts for individual countries, detected anomalies should be viewed as hypotheses rather than conclusions. The results are intended to support exploratory analysis, highlight patterns of interest, and demonstrate how anomaly detection methods can be applied to large-scale global health data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project aim\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this notebook is to develop and evaluate a robust, transparent anomaly detection workflow for country-level mortality profiles using GBD data. Specifically, the analysis seeks to answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Which countries exhibit unusual mortality patterns across multiple causes?"

Because Isolation Forest methods focus on finding the outliers first, while One-Class SVM focuses on finding normal data point first, the Isolation Forest methods are more efficient for very large datasets. Because both are unsupervised machine learning models, and the y is unknown, it is unknown which model predicts the anomalies more accurately.\n",

It allows to look at the number of features in which outliers are found and it allows to look at a specific country to show which specific disease categories have outliers."
